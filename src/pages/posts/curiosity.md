# Curiosity

Curiosity can keep your spirits up.

Curiosity may also be your downfall.



Curiosity can make your life colorful.

Curiosity may distract you from your goal.



Curiosity can make you a polymath.

Curiosity may make you a jack of all trades.



Curiosity can lead you anywhere.

Curiosity may lead you nowhere.



Curiosity is a double-edged sword.



Curiosity killed the cat. 



Ignorance is bliss.
