List of my pick of Obsidian theme and plugin, after third attempt of using Obsidian.

I am a designer, but I don't want to waste my energy on tinkering with Obsidian too much. I rather use that energy on create design works and use Obsidian for writing. That's why I aim to customize Obsidian interface as minimal as possible like a piece of blank paper.

## Essential (Function)

- Omnisearch
- Auto Link Title
- Linter
- Interstitial Journaling[^1]
- Templater

## Aesthetic (Form)

- Minimal Theme
- Minimal Theme Settings
- Notebook Navigator
- Hide Parent Tags[^2]

## Nice to Have (Honorable Mention)

- Outliner
- Baseline Theme
- Style Setting
- Typography
- Hider

## Snippets

### Minimal Interface / Focus Mode

Hide all interface with hover as trigger to show again. Inspired by [Kraa](https://kraa.io). Will also implement on this <a href="/">site</a>.

```css
.css {
}
```
