Curiosity can keep your spirits up.  
Curiosity may also be your downfall.

Curiosity can make your life colorful.  
Curiosity may distract you from your goal.

Curiosity can make you a polymath.  
Curiosity may make you a jack of all trades.

Curiosity can lead you anywhere.  
Curiosity may lead you nowhere.

Curiosity can become your beacon.  
Curiosity may lead you down the rabbit hole.

Curiosity is a double-edged sword.

Curiosity killed the cat,  
ignorance is bliss,  
but knowledge is power.
