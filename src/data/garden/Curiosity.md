Curiosity can keep your spirits up.
Curiosity may also be your downfall.

Curiosity can make your life colorful.
Curiosity may distract you from your goal.

Curiosity can make you a polymath.
Curiosity may make you a jack of all trades.

Curiosity can lead you anywhere.
Curiosity may lead you nowhere.

Curiosity can become your beacon.
Curiosity may lead you down the rabbit hole.

Curiosity is a double-edged sword.

Curiosity killed the cat, ignorance is bliss, but knowledge is power.
